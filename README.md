### Alerts
>#### Duplicate entry: If details are entered, and submitted, and the email or the website link matches any previous entries, then the application generates an alert as shown.
>In such a case, the form does not get cleared, and the user can press OK to correct their entries and retry submitting.
>However, the name and other form fields may have the same data, and no alerts are shown.
